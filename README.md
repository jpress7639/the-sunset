The Sunset Chaser - the myths, the facts, the dream!

1. **Title:** 
The Sunset Chaser

1. **Description:**
This app will be dedicated to helping users find incredible sunset spots not only around the world, but also in their backyard! The user will be able to find important information on sunsets, the science behind it, and why it is so mesmerizing to witness them. The app will also be able to show some of the most beautiful sunset spots and give off what the times the sunsets will be in that exact location. 

1. **Wireframes:**
Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

1. **MVP:**
- using the sunset/sunrise API, being able for the user to pinpoint sunset times from their exact location
- having functional slides when presenting the science behind it as well as the psychology and other facts behind it 
- making it presentable and functional on all forms of media queries
-

1. **MVP API:** 
The API you will be using, a link to the documentation, and a snippet of JSON from a successful GET request.

1. **MVP Component Heirarchy:** 
A visual tree of your components, depicting the parent/child relationships, as well as an indication of which will be class components, requiring state, and which will be functional components, taking props.

1. **MVP Timeframes:** 
How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. 

1. **Post-MVP:** 
- having a functional animated sunset using CSS as the user scrolls through the page
- Using a 2nd API to provide Moon Phases as well, and sunset quality 
- Maybe using a Component for Headspace so meditation/mindfulness excercises can be performed during one's sunset time.


1. **SWOT Analysis:** 
Strengths: 
- Aesthetic: The structure behind this page with my skills in CSS will make this app look aesthetically pleasing. 
- Content: The science and facts behind this phenomenon will be strong in this app. Also, the API will be able to give the sunset chasers the most efficient to plan their sunset viewings.
- Efficiency: The app will also be able to provide ease to the user. It will be strong in depicting each component in this app, guiding each user to the routes so they can get all the info they need. 

Weakenesses: 
- Specificity: The topic is so specific that to prove the reason behind this app will be hard to appeal to the main public.
- Components: Making sure that each component has its place in this app will be hard to differentiate.

Opportunities:
- Between the MVP and Post MVP, this app does have the opportunity to provide a certain form of headspace since a big challenge for the public is to find self-care.

Threats: 
- The API: Using a location API will be a challenge to manipulate for the app, but correctly rendering data from the Sunrise / Sunset API will be proven to be quite useful in the Sunset Chaser's plans.
